	<h1 > History of C++</h1> 
	
	<p  >C++ Programming Language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. Initially the C++ language was named as “C with classes”. “C with classes” was renamed to C++ in 1983. The “++” is increment operator in C++. It increments the variable by one value. This name demonstrates the fact that C++ is an extension of a C language.</p>
	<h1>Who is using C++ Programming Language</h1>
	<p>C++ is used in different sectors of the software industry. For example Apple OS is written in C++. Windows 95, 98, Me, 200 and XP are also written in C++. Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer and Visual Studio are written in Visual C++. All the major applications of Adobe Systems (Acrobat, Photoshop, Flash, ImageReady, Illustrator etc.) are developed using C++. Amazon.com is developing software for large scale e-commerce using C++. Google search engine, Chromium Web Browser and some other software is written in C++ too. The is a huge list of companies that are using C++.</p>
	<h1>Why to use C++</h1>
	<p>C++ is always used when there is a need in high performance and efficient applications. It’s an efficient and flexible language. The philosophy of C++ is “Any features that you do not use, you do not pay for (e.g. in performance)”. That’s why C++ is chosen when the task is to build big applications which should use less resources</p>
	<h1>About C++ version</h1>
	<p>C++ is a modern and developing language. The last standard of C++ called C++14 added a lot of features to the C++ language and fixed some bugs. This standard was introduced in March 2014.</p>

			C++ as an Object Oriented Programming Language
	C++ is one of the first languages to support object oriented programming. This means that the programs is modeled according to objects in the real world. More formally, object-oriented programming languages supports the following features:
	
		</h2><br>
	<li>	Encapsulation</li>
	<li>	Inheritance</li>
	<li>	Data Hiding</li>
	<li>	Polymorhism</li>
	</ol>
	<ol>
		<h2>Standard Libraries in C++
	Standart C++ is made up of three main parts:</h2>
		<li>	The core programming language that provides all the necessary structures including data types, variables, functions, constants etc</li>
		<li>	The C++ standard library  that gives a rich set of functions for handling components such a strings, files, input/outputs</li>
		<li>	The Standard Template Library (STL). This provides a rich set of functions for manipulating data structures.</li>
		
	</ol>
	<ol>
		<h2>Benefits of C++</h2> 
		<li>C++ applies to a wide range of application domains. This means that you can use C++ to build things like games, desktop applications, standalone applications and many more</li>
		<li>C++ is very useful in writing applications that can communicate with hardware. For example device drivers and even other Unix-based operating systems</li>
		<li>Also, C++ is used in AI research and teaching since it contains various features from basic to advanced.</li>

	 <h2>Introduction to C++ Data Types</h2>
	 <p>Data types is quite easy understand but very important. For example, a digit is different from a letter. And so on.
Also, remember that C++ is a strongly typed language. So you need to be aware of the data types available.
Just to remind you, in  a strongly typed language, you must specify the data type of your variables.
</p>
	 <h1> C++ Built-in Data Types</h1>
	 <p>Built-in data types are also called basic data types. C++ provide a number of data types which are listed in the table below:</p>
	<table border="8" width="600"> 
	<tr> 
	<th>Data Type</th> 
	<th>Keyword </th> 
	
	</tr> 
	
	<tr> 
	<td>Boolean</td> 
	<td>bool</td> 
	
	</tr> 
	<tr> 
	<td>Character</td> 
	<td>char</td> 
	
	</tr> 
	<tr> 
	<td>Integer</td> 
	<td>int</td> 
	
	</tr> 
	<tr> 
	<td>floating point</td> 
	<td>float</td> 
	
	</tr> 
	<tr> 
	<td>Double floating point</td> 
	<td>	double</td> 
	
	</tr> 
	<tr> 
	<td>valueless.</td> 
	<td>void</td> 
	
	</tr> 
	
	</table>
	<br>
	<h2>Some of these primitive data types can be modified using any of the modifiers listed below:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			•	short
		</li>
		<li>long</li>
		<li>signed</li>
		<li>unsigned</li>

	<h2>Defining and Initializing a Variable</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Before you can use a variable, you must define it. This simply means you provide a name of the variable, then you provide the data type as well. In this way, the compiler reserves the right amount of space for the variable</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Examples of how to define a variable is given belowExamples of how to define a variable is given below</h2>
